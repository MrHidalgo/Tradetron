					p.power__text.c-text!= "So instead of having 5 different strategies, you can now have 5 sets all within the same strategy. Hereâ€™s how it helps. You can now club your returns, combine different strategy basket types for portfolio diversification. All while marketing one single strategy to your subscribers. Simple yet incredibly powerful."

Never before have you seen the power of creating a complex multi position strategy on a list of underlyings. Now you can ! Apply your favorite technical indicator or any other criterion (IV, 52 week high, etc) on a list of underlyings and then take any number of positions for the ones which satisfy the condition."
